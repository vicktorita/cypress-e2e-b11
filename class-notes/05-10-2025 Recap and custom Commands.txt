		File upload & download

			Locate the file, and click on the download link. After clicking on the download button, assets folder will trigger the download directory, and put the downlaoded file in it.

			Then, we can assert if the download is success by using 
			cy.readFile() method

			cy.readFile('downloads/downloadPath/file.csv')


		File Upload

			When we download, we look for web element <input>. Simply, input file will be created with type="file" which indicates that we can upload a file in it. After locating this input,

			cy.get('uploadInput').selectFile('downloads/downloadPath/file.csv')			=> single file upload


			cy.get('uploadInput').selectFile(['downloads/file.csv', 'path2'])			=> multiple files upload


			cy.get('uploadInput').selectFile('downloads/downloadPath/file.csv', { action: 'drag-drop' })
